We'll even take a look at the upcoming GitLab contribution process because specific tools and processes change over time.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPrerequisites:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A basic understanding of Drupal and maybe the command line (but not necessary)<\/li>\r\n\t<li>A computer<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This activity will take place within <a href=\"https:\/\/hopin.com\/events\/drupalcampnyc-2020?code=b2db991f2c5726ba08924d4e7a2b\">Hopin<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n",
