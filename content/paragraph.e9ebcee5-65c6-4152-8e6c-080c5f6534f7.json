BoFs exist to provide attendees with an inclusive, informal environment in which to share ideas freely. BoFs can be serious and a great way to gather the people you\u2019ve been working remotely with on a project in a space to deep dive on a topic, but they can also be fun as well. Knitting BoF? Why not?<\/p>\r\n",
