description: "This is used to sort things based first on sponsor level then on how soon we received payment. Add the base level value:\r\nVenue: 0\r\nDiamond: 100\r\nPlatinum: 200\r\nGold: 300\r\nHomegrown: 400\r\nCommunity: 500\r\nTri-State: 600\r\nIn-Kind: 700\r\n\r\nThen add n where n is the order in which we received payment from the sponsor at that level.\r\n\r\nFor example, the second Gold sponsor we receive payment from would have a weight of 302."
